        <P class="work-text">Architecture typically doesn't move. But what if there were movable architecture? Such architecture would respond to the environment, transforming itself and acting as a "medium" that reflects the environment. In that case, how should we express the quality of this architecture in drawings?</P>

            Rhinoceros is software primarily used in the fields of product design and architecture for modeling. It includes a feature called Grasshopper, which allows for parametric design to be procedurally scripted. I personally use it extensively in my studies in architecture.
            <br>
            <br>In this exhibition, our aim was to allow everyone to touch and experience the process of parametric exploration using Rhinoceros & Grasshopper.
        </P>
        <!-- <P class="work-text ja">
            Rhinocerosはプロダクトデザインや建築の分野で主にモデリングソフトとして用いられているソフトウェアです。パラメトリックデザインがプロシージャルに組めるGrasshopperという機能もあり私自身建築学科で愛用しています。
            <br><br>この展示では、そんなRhinoceros&Grasshopperでパラメトリックな検討を行う過程を、すべての人に触れてもらい、体験してもらうことを目指しました。
        </P> -->

        <P class="work-text">
            This project involved collaboration with VUILD, a company advancing manufacturing using ShopBot, to propose a product theme of "junctions in daily life," using two plywood sheets. The product I created generates space by attaching it to trees.
            <br><br>By incorporating a movable mechanism, it can be attached to trees of various shapes, and by reflecting the shape of the tree in the rhythm of the roof height, the product and the tree organically come to life with a sense of unity. This was the key point I aimed to convey in the exhibition.
